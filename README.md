## ContactlessHandSanitizerDispenser

Engineering class project where we had to make a contactless hand sanitizer dispenser.
We 3D printed a shell to be able to hold the components for the project with the delivery system being a servo connected to an arduino that would push on the pump head
We used an ultrasonic sensor to determine whether there was a hand to dispense to and it would also dispense more or less depending on how far away the users hand is.

## Circuit and Components
There is a visual demonstration of the wiring and components if anyone wishes to recreate this project. This is missing the main housing unit that we 3D printed.
To create this project we used a arduino board, a servo, and a ultrasonic sensor to detect and dispense the hand sanitizer.
