# ContactlessHandSanitizerDispenser

## Engineering class project where we had to make a contactless hand sanitizer dispenser.
## We 3D printed a shell to be able to hold the components for the project with the delivery system being a servo connected to an arduino that would push on the pump head
## We used an ultrasonic sensor to determine whether there was a hand to dispense to and it would also dispense more or less depending on how far away the users hand is.
